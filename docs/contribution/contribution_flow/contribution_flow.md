## 4. Add document

If you add some feature, you must add the document like `README.md`.
The target of document is as below.

- `/docs/*`: Design documents for developers

Design documents aims for developers.
So you should write "why we should do" for documents.

- `/tools/*`: Process documents for engineer users

Process documents aims for engineer users.
So you should write "how we should do" for documents assuming that users know basic command linux around machine learning.
You can assume the user can fix the bug in the tools on their own.

- `/pipelines/*`: Process documents for non-engineer users

Process documents aims for non-engineer users.
So you should write "how we should do" for documents assuming that users do not know basic linux command.

## 5. Test by CI/CD

For now, integration test is done on local environment.

## 6. Make PR

When you make the PR, you check [PR rule](/docs/contribution/contribution_flow/pr_rule.md) and the list of "Use case for contribution" in [contribution docs](/docs/contribution/contribution.md).
