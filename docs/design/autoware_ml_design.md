### The pipeline design of `AWML`

![](/docs/fig/pipeline.drawio.svg)

>  Orange line: the deployment flow for ML model.

- (1) create_data_info.py
  - Make info file with annotated data.
- (2) train.py, (3) test.py, (4) visualize.py
  - From config file, the ML model is trained and evaluated.
- (5) deploy.py
  - If the model is used for Autoware, the model is deployed to onnx file.

> Green line: the pipeline for active learning

- (6) pseudo_label.py
  - Make info file from non-annotated T4dataset for 2D and 3D.
- (7) create_pseudo_t4dataset.py
  - Make pseudo-label T4dataset from the info file which is based on pseudo label.
- (8) choose_annotation.py
  - Choose using annotation from raw pseudo label.
  - The info file which is used in [mmdetection3d](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection3d) by pickle file (`.pkl`) is used in auto labeling  of `AWML` as interface.
  - For example, it is used for `scene_selector` and `pseudo_label` to tune the parameter of the threshold of confidence with offline model.

### The format of infos file

- We use the format of info files based on [the NuScenes format](https://mmdetection3d.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced_guides/datasets/nuscenes.html?highlight=info).

## `AWML` architecture
### autoware_ml/

The directory of `autoware_ml` is library for autoware-ml.
This directory can be used as library from other software and this directory doesn't depend on other directories.

- `autoware_ml/detection3d`

It provides the core library of 3D detection.
It contain loader and metrics for T4dataset.

- `autoware_ml/configs`

The config files in `autoware_ml` is used commonly for each projects.

```
- autoware_ml/
  - configs/
    - detection3d/
      - XX1.py
      - X2.py
      - db_jpntaxi_v1.yaml
      - db_jpntaxi_v2.yaml
      - db_jpntaxi_v3.yaml
    - detection2d/
      - XX1.py

      - db_jpntaxi_v1.yaml
      - db_jpntaxi_v2.yaml
      - tlr_v1_0.yaml
```

- dataset configs: `autoware_ml/configs/*.yaml`

The file like `detection3d/db_jpntaxi_v1.yaml` defines dataset ids of T4dataset.
We define T4dataset version as below.

- version: major.minor.build
  - major: sensor configuration
  - minor: dataset scenes
  - build: dataset version

### docs/

The directory of `docs/` is design documents for `AWML`.
The target of documents is a designer of whole ML pipeline system and developers of `AWML` core library.

### pipelines/

The directory of `pipelines/` manages the pipelines that consist of `tools`.
This directory can depend on `/autoware_ml`, `projects`, `/tools`, and other `/pipelines`.

Each pipeline has `README.md`, a process document to use when you ask someone else to do the work.
The target of `README.md` is a user of `AWML`.

### projects/

The directory of `projects/` manages the model for each tasks.
This directory can depend on `/autoware_ml` and other `projects`.

```

  - BEVFusion
  - YOLOX
  - TransFusion
```

Each project has `README.md` for users.
The target of `README.md` is a user of `AWML`.

### tools/

The directory of `tools/` manages the tools for each tasks.
`tools/` scripts are abstracted. For example, `tools/detection3d` can be used for any 3D detection models such as TransFusion and BEVFusion.
This directory can depend on `/autoware_ml` and other `/tools`.


```

```

Each tool has `README.md` for developers.
The target of `README.md` is a developer of `AWML`.

## Support priority

We define "support priority" for each tools and projects. Maintainers handle handle the issues according to the priority as below.

- Tier S:
  - It is core function in ML system and it updates frequently from any requests.
  - We strive to make it high maintainability with code quality, unit test and CI/CD.
  - We put highest priority on support and maintenance to it because it leads to fast cycle development for developers.
- Tier A:
  - It is maintenance phase on development, so it's updates is not frequently.
  - We make it maintainability with code quality, unit test and CI/CD, if possible.
  - We put a high priority on support to it.
- Tier B:
  - We fix a broken tool when needed.
  - We put a middle priority on support to it.
- Tier C:
  - We rarely use a tool or a model or it is just prototype version.
  - If it is not used for long time, we delete it.
  - We put a low priority on support to it.

## Versioning strategy for `AWML`

We follow basically [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).
As our strategy, we follow as below.

- Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development.
  - The public API should not be considered stable.
- Major version X (X.y.z | X > 0) is incremented if any backward incompatible changes are introduced to the public API.
- Minor version Y (x.Y.z | x > 0) is incremented if new, backward compatible functionality is introduced to the public API.
  - It is incremented if any public API functionality is marked as deprecated.
  - It is incremented if a new project is added.
- Patch version Z (x.y.Z | x > 0) is incremented if only backward compatible bug fixes are introduced.
  - A bug fix is defined as an internal change that fixes incorrect behavior.
  - It is incremented if a new model is released.
