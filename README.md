This repository is a machine learning library to deploy for [Autoware](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware) to aim for "robotics MLOps".
`AWML` supports training with [T4dataset format](https://github.com/tier4/tier4_perception_dataset) in addition to open datasets and deployment for [Autoware](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware).
In addition to ML model deployment, `AWML` supports active learning framework include auto labeling, semi-auto labeling, and data mining.

`AWML` can deploy following task for now.

- 2D detection for dynamic recognition
- 3D detection for dynamic recognition
- 2D fine detection for traffic light recognition
- 2D classification for traffic light recognition

`AWML` supports following environment.

- All tools are tested by [Docker environment](Dockerfile) on Ubuntu 22.04LTS
- NVIDIA dependency: CUDA 12.1 + cuDNN 8
  - Need > 530.xx.xx NVIDIA device driver

If you use this project in your research, please use [the arXiv paper of AWML](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00645) and [the arXiv paper for fine-tuning strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04711).

`AWML` is based on [Autoware Core & Universe strategy](https://autoware.org/autoware-overview/).
We hope that `AWML` promotes the community between Autoware and ML researchers and engineers.
